    <p>Hello from Halifax, the (EDIT: former) great oasis against coronavirus!</p>
    <p>We are again hosting our BSides Halifax infosec conference entirely online, and we'd really like you to attend.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, this will be your last ever pandemic conference, so it provides a great opportunity to share your lessons learned over the past 12 months. Did you learn how to manage your VPN more efficiently at high load, or discover a new MDM solution you think everyone should be using? We want to hear about it.</p>
    <p>The conference will be held on June 18th at https://BSidesHalifax.ca, and is accessible via laptop, tablet, phone, and whatever other sanitized devices have been made available to your quarantine facility.</p>

    <h3>Call For Speakers</h3>
    <p>BSides Halifax 2021, this is going to be our year! Low case rates, vaccination proceeding swiftly, we're looking forward to finally getting together in per... wait, what's that?</p>
    <p>...I don't understand, why is it <a href=\"
    https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2020fa/textbook/data/variants.html\" target=\"blank\">OCaml's</a> fault we're online again this year?</p>
    <p>...Oh, DIFFERENT kind of variant. Got it.</p>
    <p>Yes, we are online again this year, and this one's going to be even better, because this time, we sort of know what we're doing!</p>
    <p>BSides Halifax 2021 is looking for a diverse group of speakers to present all manner of interesting things. Last year, we had speakers from all over Canada and America, on topics like reducing your cyber risk, threat hunting, and purple teaming, so if you don't live locally, or don't think your topic qualifies, submit a pitch anyway! You might get in.</p>

    <p><b>The submission process goes like this:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Jeff, I don't know how the process goes. Write a list of steps, make it seem easy and fun.</p></li>
      <li><p>Send an email to <a href=\"mailto:info@bsideshalifax.ca\">info@bsideshalifax.ca</a> and be sure to tell us the title of your talk, a brief description (including length), where you are located, if you have any time constraints, what your favorite color is, and what your quest is.</p></li>
    </ul>
<br />
<h5>So if you are ready to make your (hopefully) last pandemic conference your best, send us a pitch. Why not start right now?</h5>
