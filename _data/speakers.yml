  name: "Naomi"
  surname: "Peori"
  company: "GoSecure, WoSec"
  title: "CTF for Beginners"
  bio: "Naomi grew up on the mean streets of Dartmouth and is famous for nothing serious because she was young and indiscreet before social media ruined privacy. She prefers Asimov, Tesla (boo Edison!), Solid Snake, Luigi and MIPS. Her interests include habanero farming, calibrating displays to perfection, hacking game consoles and if you ever really need a video game she probably has two copies. Although her talk is about capturing flags, she can also speak confidently on the quirks of 6502 opcodes, training machines to think and what it was like to do network sniffing in the 90's."
