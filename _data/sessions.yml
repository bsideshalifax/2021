  title: "KeyNote: The power of storytelling: transforming cybersecurity awareness into action."
  speakers: [1]
  language: en
  description: "It’s 2021 and with major cyber-attacks capturing headlines daily, cybersecurity awareness isn’t our number one challenge anymore as cybersecurity professionals. We’ve never been more aware across society that cybersecurity is an issue. While everyone in security deserves a well-earned congratulations for the work we’ve done to raise awareness, a greater challenge has now presented itself: moving from awareness to care-ness and get people to not just know that security is an issue, but to change individual and organizational behaviours. <br />During this keynote presentation, Beauceron CEO David Shipley will talk about the critical importance of leveraging storytelling as a framework to educate and to motivate. He’ll provide examples and a framework for how this practice can be used to move awareness programs into effective behaviour change initiatives that can tangibly reduce cyber risk in organizations.

  title: "Growing Female Talent in Security"
  description: "Dinah Davis originally planned to become a math teacher at the suggestion of her high school guidance counsellor, because that's what girls who are good at math do right?! By the end of her second year she discovered that she loved mathematics more than her desire to teach children. In her third year of university she took her first computing course and felt she found her calling. Software development felt like a natural progression for her mathematically trained mind. A year later she worked for the Canadian Security Establishment as a coop and discovered cryptography which lead her to an MMath in Cryptography from the University of Waterloo.  She landed a dream job working on BlackBerry's security development team for 8 years.  Why do you care? Because this story is not unique. Many women in security have found there way there through trial and error. This talk dives into the current state of women in security and what we need to do as a community to help more women find this amazing career. "

In this talk I will be talking about the attack and doing live demos"

  description: "Not every bug you find is going to be an unauthenticated remote code execution. Sometimes you just find a couple of small issues here and there. In this talk, we'll look at how small bugs, mixed with a bit of creativity, can sometimes lead to large impacts. As a case study, we'll examine how a simple, and seemingly benign input validation issue in Microsoft Power Apps could be used to steal authorization tokens, emails, OneDrive files and more from Microsoft Teams users via malicious tabs.
